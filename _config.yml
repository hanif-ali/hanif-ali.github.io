  Hello There! My name is Hanif. I am a Software Developer driven by passion for Programming, Mathematics and Problem Solving. I started coding as early as age 14. Python and JavaScript are my languages of choice. I am engaged in Web Development for most of my time, although I work in other domains as well. I am also a contributor to FOSS on Github.
  
  I have been working as a Freelance Developer for around a year now, mostly working on Python and Javascript. I have been working with clients around the globe, maintaining a Job Success Score of 100% and achieving Top Rated Status on Upwork.

  Apart from Web Development, I have an interest in Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. I Windows 10 with WSL (Fedora/Ubuntu) as my primary operating system. I prefer Tea over Coffee, Vim over Emacs, and Tabs over Spaces. In my free time, I like to listen to Music, Write/Blog or lift some weights.

  If you are interested in hiring me for work, you can connect to me on Upwork <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01e4e24f6f1a812341/">here</a>.
