  Hello There! My name is Hanif. I am a Programmer and Software Engineering student driven by passion for Programming, Mathematics and Problem Solving. I started coding when I was 14. Python and JavaScript are my languages of choice. I like to develop Web Applications, although I am exploring various other domains as well. I am also a newbie contributor to FOSS on Github.

  I am interested in Machine Learning and Cloud Computing and want to explore them further in the future. I use Linux as my full-time operating system and prefer VSCode or Vim as a text-editor. In my free time, I like to listen to Music, Write/Blog or lift some weights.
